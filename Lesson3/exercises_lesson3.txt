    Create an empty array which can contain ten integers.

        Fill that array with numbers 10, 20, …​, 100. (Hint: use loops)

        Print only the elements of that array that are on odd indices (values 20, 40, …​).

        Multiply elements on even indices by 5. Print the modified array.

    Re-do the Collatz conjecture exercise, but this time instead of printing each step, add it to a sequence.

        Pick a starting number. Interesting choices, among others, are 9, 19, 25 and 27.

        Create a sequence whose only member is that starting number

        Using the same logic as before, keep adding elements to the sequence until you reach 1

        Print the length of the sequence, and the sequence itself

    Find the number in a range from 2 to 100 which will produce the longest Collatz sequence.

        For each number in the given range calculate its Collatz sequence

        If the length of current sequence is longer than the previous record, save the current length and the starting number as a new record (you can use the tuple (longestLength, startingNumber) or two separate variables)

        Print the starting number which gives the longest sequence, and its length
